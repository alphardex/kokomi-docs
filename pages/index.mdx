## Hello world

With just several lines, you can make a most basic 3D scene :d

index.html

```html
<div id="sketch"></div>
```

style.css

```css
#sketch {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  background: black;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

script.js

```js
import * as kokomi from "kokomi.js";

class Sketch extends kokomi.Base {
  create() {
    new kokomi.OrbitControls(this);

    const box = new kokomi.Box(this);
    box.addExisting();

    this.update((time) => {
      box.spin(time);
    });
  }
}

const createSketch = () => {
  const sketch = new Sketch();

## Features

- You can simply extend `kokomi.Base` class to kickstart a simple scene without writing any boilerplate codes.
- Either you can write all your three.js code in a single file, or encapsulate your code into individual classes in a large project. By extending `kokomi.Component`, you can make your components keep their own state and animation.
- `kokomi.AssetManager` can handle the preloads of assets (gltfModel, texture, cubeTexture, font, etc). You can just write a simple js object to config your assets without caring about various loaders.
- Integrated with [three.interactive](https://github.com/markuslerner/THREE.Interactive), which can handle mouse and touch interactions easily.
- Many more [useful components](https://kokomi-js.netlify.app/examples/) for you to discover!
