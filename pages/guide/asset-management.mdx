# Asset Management

Managing assets in kokomi.js is pretty easy!

## Traditional way

When using vanilla three.js, we usually load assets like this:

```js
const texLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
const tex = texLoader.load("asset url");
...

const gltfLoader = new GLTFLoader();
gltfLoader.load("asset url", (gltf) => {
    const model = gltf.scene;
    ...
});
```

Actually this is totally acceptable and intuitive.

But if we want to load many assets with different types, it will be very messy.

So we need to load assets in a more uniform way.

## kokomi.js way

First, you define a list of assets.

```js
const resourceList = [
  {
    name: "tex",
    type: "texture",
    path: "asset url",
  },
  {
    name: "model",
    type: "gltfModel",
    path: "asset url",
  },
];
```

Note that the list item has 3 fields: `name`, `type` and `path`.

- `name` is just the key name of asset.
- `type` is the type of asset, includes: `texture`, `gltfModel`, `cubeTexture`, etc. Different type has its corresponding loader, such as `texture` - `THREE.TextureLoader`, etc. You can view all the types with `kokomi.ResourceItem` ts type or [source code](https://github.com/alphardex/kokomi.js/blob/c2e021abd42c2ca56387db519ac9355741791769/src/components/assetManager.ts#L20C21-L20C21).
- `path` is the url of asset, if you are using a bundler (e.g. vite), it has its own way of handling asset url. (such as `import` statement)

Then create the asset manager:

```js
const am = new kokomi.AssetManager(this, resourceList);
```

The asset manager will automatically start to load all the assets in the list, you just need to listen for the load complete (which is `ready`) event.
After loading complete, you can access the assets via the instance's `items`, which is just a map of asset's key name and its content.

```js
am.on("ready", () => {
  const tex = am.items.tex;
  const model = am.items.model;
  // handle these assets ...
});
```
